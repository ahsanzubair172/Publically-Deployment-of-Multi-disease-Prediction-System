**How it works:**

_The system operates by training machine learning models on extensive medical datasets 
to recognize patterns for disease prediction._

**How to use it:**

_To use our disease prediction system, simply select the disease you are interested in from the sidebar.
You will then be asked to provide some information about yourself, such as your symptoms, medical history, lifestyle habits, and demographic data. Once you have provided this information, 
our system will generate a prediction of the likelihood of you having the disease._

**Please note:**

_Remember, this tool is not a substitute for professional medical advice.
 Always consult a doctor for health concerns._

**Gender:**  This is your biological identification as male , female or other.

**Age:**  Your age, which helps determine your risk of developing diabetes as it often increases with age.

**Hypertension:**  It's high blood pressure, a condition where your blood pushes against the walls of your arteries with too much force.

**Heart Disease:**  This refers to various conditions that affect the heart, which can increase diabetes risk.

**Smoking History:**  Whether or not you have a history of smoking, which can be a risk factor.

**BMI (Body Mass Index):**  This is a measure of your body weight compared to your height. Higher values may indicate a higher risk of diabetes.

**Hemoglobin A1c Level:**  A measure of your average blood sugar levels over several months. High levels suggest a risk of diabetes.

**Blood Glucose Level:**  It's the amount of sugar (glucose) in your blood. High levels can be an early sign of diabetes.

**Age:** This is the patient's age. It's an important factor because heart disease risk often increases with age.

**Sex:** This refers to the patient's gender. It's used in prediction models because heart disease can affect men and women differently.

**CP (Chest Pain):** CP is a feature that describes the type of chest pain a patient experiences. There are typically four types:

0: No chest pain

1: Typical angina (a type of chest discomfort)

2: Atypical angina

3: Non-anginal pain


**Trestbps:** This is the resting blood pressure of the patient. High blood pressure can be a risk factor for heart disease.

**Chol (Cholesterol):** It represents the patient's cholesterol level. High cholesterol can contribute to heart disease.

**FBS (Fasting Blood Sugar):** This indicates the patient's fasting blood sugar level. Elevated sugar levels may be associated with diabetes, a risk factor for heart disease.

**Restecg (Resting ECG):** It describes the results of the patient's resting electrocardiogram. It helps assess heart health.The selection of values 0 to 2 representing "_normal_" , "_abnormality_" and "_left ventricular hypertrophy_".

**Thalach:** This is the maximum heart rate achieved during exercise. A lower maximum heart rate might indicate heart issues.

**Exang (Exercise-Induced Angina):** It tells if the patient experiences angina during exercise, which can be a sign of heart problems.

**Oldpeak:** This is related to changes in the ST segment of the ECG during exercise. It's another indicator of heart health.

**Slope:** It describes the slope of the peak exercise ST segment. It's part of the ECG data and contributes to diagnosis.
The values 0 to 2 representing "_upsloping_" , "_flat_" and "_downsloping_".

**Thal (Thalassemia):** Thalassemia is a blood disorder, and different types of thalassemia can affect the heart. The type of thalassemia, with options "_Normal_" , "Fixed_" , "_Reversible_" and "_Irreversible_" represented by values 0 to 3

**Ca (Number of Major Vessels):** It represents the number of major blood vessels supplying the heart. There are four types of it 
  0: This indicates that there are no major blood vessels with a significant narrowing or obstruction. It suggests a healthier cardiovascular system.

  1: One major blood vessel shows narrowing or obstruction. This might indicate a mild blockage.

  2: Two major blood vessels exhibit narrowing or obstruction. This could imply a moderate level of blockage.

  3: Three major blood vessels have narrowing or obstruction. This suggests a significant level of blockage in multiple vessels.

  4: Four major blood vessels with narrowing or obstruction. This is a substantial indication of blockage, and it typically signifies a higher risk of heart disease..
